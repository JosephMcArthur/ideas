# About

This repo is for keeping and possibly developing ideas that I:
* cannot immediately put into practice myself
* think may be worth another look, including by people who come in here via search engines

# Mechanics

I have yet to figure this out in detail, but probably mainly via issues, perhaps with a "meta" label for things that are about the repo rather than about research ideas. 

# License
